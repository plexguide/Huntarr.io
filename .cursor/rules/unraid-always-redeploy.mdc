# Unraid: Always Redeploy After Code Changes

- **Always deploy our LOCAL build, never the image from Docker Hub.** Pulling `huntarr/huntarr:latest` from Docker Hub would deploy a published release (often older than this repo). We deploy what we have here: build from this repo’s source and deploy that.
- **Deploy target: always Unraid unless the user explicitly says to do it locally.** When they ask to deploy, redeploy, or run the container, use Unraid. Only use local Docker when they say "local" or "run it locally".
- **After making any code changes to Huntarr, ALWAYS run the Unraid deploy.** Do not wait for the user to ask. Do it automatically so they can test immediately.
- Command: `cd /Users/home/Huntarr/Huntarr.io && ./unraid/deploy-with-build.exp`
- This copies local source to Unraid, builds the image there (`huntarr-moviehunt-local:latest`), and deploys to the huntarr-moviehunt container on Unraid (10.0.0.10). URL: http://10.0.0.10:9720
- **Do not use** `./unraid/deploy-moviehunt-with-mounts.exp` for normal deploys—that script uses `huntarr/huntarr:latest` from Docker Hub, not our local code.
- Run this at the end of the conversation turn whenever you have modified project source files (Python, JS, HTML, CSS, templates, etc.).
- If Unraid deploy fails (e.g. unreachable), then run local: `docker-compose down && COMPOSE_BAKE=true docker-compose up -d --build`.
